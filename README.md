# Tic-tac-toe

> Simple tic-tac-toe game implemented with html, css and javascript.

## Notes

- I've only included the css for Bootstrap (since we don't need the js, and it's good to practice without it).
- I've used browser-sync to make life easier and experience a more industry dev like environment

## Setup

1. Clone this repository to your machine
2. Install dependencies using `npm i` in the root of this repository
3. Start the `browser-sync` dev server using `npm start`.
4. Modify files and see live reloading!
